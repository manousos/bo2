## Introduction ##
In the context of a business application almost all classes can be described by predefined stereotypes. Stereotypes as entity, persistence utility, rule, business operation, etc are well known and easily identified. Each stereotype has behavior common to all classes that belong to it. The common behavior can be modeled by an interface.

## Development process ##
Analysis starts with documentation of use case flows. Steps or  sub-flows (actions) of each flow are assigned to the predefined stereotypes. The system design arises from this process. Mapping of stereotypes to interfaces guarantees conformance between design and development. It also guarantees that all developers have a common understanding about the responsibilities of each class.
