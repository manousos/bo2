#summary Principles guiding the development of Bo2.

== Principles for long lasting maintainable software ==
  * Architecture-centric development process
  * Program to interfaces
  * Map an interface to each stereotype class
  * Separate layers
    * Data access
    * Entity model
    * Business logic
    * User interface
  * The business layer must be agnostic of the implementation details
  * Keep the system open to yet unknown technologies
  * Minimize the size of code
     * Move utilities to separate 
     * Eliminate boilerplate code
  * Write once - run everywhere


Architecture centric, code generation on runtime.

Write once run everywhere.

Runtime layer abstraction.

Avoid platform specific code (Streams, etc)

Provider interface.

Separate utilities from business code

Utilities must be in different project.
