/**
 * This package contains implementation of named streams resources.
 * 
 * The idea of named streams is not new. It remains strong in 
 * mainframe computing. According to this idea, files are 
 * declared in programs using logical names. The real filename 
 * that is associated with a logical name is given as input to
 * the program. <br/>
 * This implementation of named streams also supports some other
 * characteristics of mainframe programming, as fixed length 
 * records. <br/>
